Odin Recipe Project

This is the initial Odin Recipe Project that I'm working on. 
A test of the HTML knowledge obtained in the prior lessons.
Upon completion, it will display a fundamental basic knowledge of setting up an HTML website with multiple pages.  Additionally, it will display proper usage of Git and Github with appropriate comments.
