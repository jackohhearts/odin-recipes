        <p>The classic <strength>Smashburger</strength> is a delicous staple of American cuisine. A personal 
        favorite of mine, loving to make it at least once a month. There's nothing quite like the layers 
        of flavors sandwiched between two beautifully toasted buns. The technique of smashing the patty into
        a blazing hot pan is truly what sets this apart from a normal burger. It creates an astoundingly 
        delightful crust on the outside, that is simply delightful.  Virtually <em>any</em> toppings pair
        extremely well this classic. So feel free to explore! </p>

          </ul>

        <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Form the ground beef into golf ball shapes, weighing around a quarter pound each.</li>          
            <li>Slice your onions and tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Preheat a cast iron or heavy bottomed skillet until it's very hot.</li>
            <li>Toast the buns in butter until beauitifully brown.</li>
            <li>"Dope" the buns with mayo, mustard, and toppings being used, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, etc.</li>
            <li>Drop a small teaspoon or so of oil into the hot pan.</li>
            <li>Drop the burger ball into the pan, and immediately smash it down with a large metal spatula. </li>
            <li>Season the top with salt and peppar.</li>
            <li>Depending on the size, they can cook quick! I use the eye test when you start to see bubbles on top.</li>
            <li>With a thin spatula, get underneath and give them a good flip.</li>
            <li>Immediately apply the cheese to the top.</li>
            <li>Cover for a minute or so until melted.  (They cook quickly at this point!)</li>
            <li>Remove and place on "doped" bun.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
